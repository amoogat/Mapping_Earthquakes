# Mapping Earthquakes
This project involves using geoJSON data to create a map of earthquakes in the last 7 days
- "Earthquakes_past7days": uses an API call to fetch data on earthquakes and then JavaScript to map and color code as well as add legend.
- "Earthquakes_Challenge": here we see earthquakes are frequent along the fault lines, which can be toggled in the top right corner. They slowly fizzle out the further away from a fault line that a geographic location is, as expected and is corroborated by the updated data.
